# stock_price_prediction
Implementing a LSTM.nn to predict the future prices of an equity as my Capstone Project for my **Data Science Nanodegree Certification** at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)

## MY MOTIVATION FOR THIS PROJECT - _Business Understanding_

As an engineer, number lover, data scientist, and AI student, and as a young investor, I have always loved the idea of using my knowledge and understanding to predict the future prices of any stock traded on the stock market, if this were possible. My little experience in machine learning and deep learning algorithms, and the access that technology has given me to a vast amount of data related to these stocks, makes me believe that I can find that magic formula and predict prices in the future, and possibly have some benefit from it.

This idea to predict future prices or events of very important assets that follows a time series data structure, the kind of data I dealt with in this project, is widely researched and developed by the biggest funds and banks worldwide, whom invest a lot of money and resources in the search for the perfect signals to invest.

More than succeeding in this challenge and finishing my Data Science Course, I am very excited by all the experiences lived during this project, and the knowledge gained which definitely prepared me to improve this type of models or any other time series model in the future.

## THE DATA:

The data used in this project was collected thanks to the [Alpha_Vantage_API](https://www.alphavantage.co).

If you will collect the data from the source, you will need to create an Alpha Vantage Account and fill the API variable created for that purpose in the first cell of our notebook.

You can also avoid the collection with the '**_loading_**' function created.

The data downloaded comes with the OHLC prices information (Open, High, Low, Close) plus the volume info. The 'close' price data is already adjusted.

For our training purposes here, I only used the 'close' and 'volume' data, and two more features related to them.


## THE PROCESS:

The project here is divided in five big sections:

1. The global variables declaration, where I specified all the parameters to be involved in our trains.
2. Gathering and cleaning the data, where I start collecting and processing all the input data to our model.
3. Modeling, where I start with the process of creation of the LSTM model and start testing it.
4. Looking for Stationarity, a second part where we first deal with the stationarity need for our time series.
5. Final training, where we performed our final approaches for predicting the stock prices.
6. Other unsuccsesful trials performed.


## A BRIEF SUMMARY IN IMAGES:

Some images can help me to show you the process and the results achieved:
